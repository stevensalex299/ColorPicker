## How To Use

To use the Color Picker Widget, select any color displayed under default colors (consists of primary and secondary colors of multiple shades).

When a color is selected, the hex value for that color will be copied to the clipboard. General information for the color will also be displayed in the selection area.

For accessability, the color grid can be manuevered using the arrow keys on the keyboard as well as the tab keys. To select a color with keyboard input, use the Enter key or Spacebar key. The Color Picker Widget is also responsive and adjusts its grid size for smaller screens (< 480px).
